# Import External AppFlowy Data

AppFlowy allows you to import data from an external 'AppFlowyDataDoNotRename' folder. It will merge all data from
the chosen external folder into your current AppFlowy data folder.

To import, navigate to `Settings` --> `Files` --> `Import Data from External AppFlowy Folder` and select the external AppFlowy
data folder you want to import.

Once the import is complete, the data from the external folder will be visible in your current AppFlowy data folder.

# Migration from AppFlowy (Supabase) to Latest AppFlowy Version

Start by opening your AppFlowy (Supabase) application. Then, go to `Settings` --> `Files` --> `Open current data directory` to access the current data folder.

Next, compress all the AppFlowy application data into a ZIP file and save it in a new directory as illustrated here.

Unzip the folder, and then download the latest AppFlowy application. Open the application and start as anonymous user.
Go to `Settings` --> `Files` --> `Import Data from External AppFlowy Folder`

Select the folder that just unzipped.

# Custom AppFlowy Data Folder 

When you launch the application the first time, you will be able to set the directory where you want to store your AppFlowy data. Click on `Set` to open the file explorer and choose your preferred path. In the example below, the data will be stored under G:\My Drive\05 Notes. Then click Quick Start.

<mark style="color:red;">Do not put the folder under your Google Drive.</mark>&#x20;

If you're unsure about changing the data directory now, just select 'Quick Start' without making any changes. You can always modify the 
data directory later within the application. For cloud data storage options, see the [Self-Hosting AppFlowy Cloud](../../guides/appflowy/self-hosting-appflowy.md) guide.

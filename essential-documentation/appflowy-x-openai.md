The OpenAI [features](appflowy-x-openai.md#what-are-the-current-functions-of-openai-in-appflowy) only connect to the specified domain: openai.com

Here are the OpenAI API calls triggered by our OpenAI [features](appflowy-x-openai.md#what-are-the-current-functions-of-openai-in-appflowy):

The OpenAI key you provided in `Settings` is stored on your local device where you installed AppFlowy.

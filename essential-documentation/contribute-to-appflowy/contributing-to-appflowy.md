# 🟢 Get started

Hello, and welcome! Whether you are trying to report a bug, proposing a feature request, thinking about getting involved in the project, or submitting a patch, this document is for you! It intends to be both an entry point for newcomers to AppFlowy's community (with various backgrounds), and a guide/reference for contributors.

## Contributing

There are many ways in which you can contribute to the project. You can be involved just a little, or a whole lot! Every lit bit helps and is very appreciated by everyone.

### Feedback

Not feeling quite up to working on the project yet? Tell us your suggestions!

* Submit [feature requests](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues). We'd love to hear your ideas!
* Report [bugs](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues). This really helps a lot!
* Provide your suggestions on the [forum](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/discussions)
* Review [Pull Requests](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/pulls)
* Provide feedback to [proposed features](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues)

### Non-coding Contributions

You want to help out with the project, but you're not a developer? You can help in multiple ways - even if you don't write code! You can still give back your love as part of our community. Here are a few ideas:

* Answer questions having ""General help wanted" or "Technical help wanted" labels on the [forum](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/discussions)
* Improve the documentation.
* Be an AppFlowy ambassador or evangelist! Proprietary software companies often have dedicated marketing teams to get more users, but luckily we have something better: you! Share your experience with AppFlowy! This can be anything:
  * Write a life-hacks-style blog post on how you or your company use AppFlowy to get things done.
  * Spread the word on all social media platforms to get more people to join the community. To name a few channels, Product Hunt, Hacker Noon, Quora, Reddit, and Stack Overflow are good choices.
  * Give a lightning talk at your local hackerspace on why you love AppFlowy.
  * Write a review of the pros and cons of similar open source apps.

### Coding Contributions

So you want to submit code, documentation, or graphical expertise? Welcome to the club! We will try to give you all the help you need to get up and running.

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9Q2xaN37tV). Here you will be able to chat with all of our contributors and the heads of the project.
* Read the documentation. You should start at the main README.md where you will find information on how to setup your computer to develop with Flutter and Rust.
* Read the technical wiki. This is where you will find all of our design documentation. (TBD)
* Submit a Patch. We love to receive Pull Requests. If you are a beginner or a newcomer, here are some tasks for you to get ramped up:
  * Fix a typo in the code.
  * Fix a typo in the documentation.
  * Awesome issues for [beginners or newcomers](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue+for+devs%22).
  * Provide feedback [proposed features](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues)
  * Review [Pull Requests](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/pulls)
* If you are ready to code (maybe a lot), please submit a [patch](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/pulls)!
  * (WIP: guidelines)
  * (WIP: Code Style)

### Your First Codebase Contribution

This section has a step-by-step guide to starting as an AppFlowy codebase contributor. Don’t worry if you make mistakes in your first contribution; no one gets it right the first time.

* First, make an account on the [AppFlowy community server](https://discord.gg/9Q2xaN37tV), and pay attention to the community norms.
* Set up your [AppFlowy development environment](software-contributions/environment-setup/), getting help [on the forum](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/discussions) or in #general on [the community server](https://discord.gg/9Q2xaN37tV).
* Familiarize yourself with using the development environment
* Check out [How we built AppFlowy with Flutter and Rust](https://blog-appflowy.ghost.io/tech-design-flutter-rust/)
* Read the [Submitting Code](software-contributions/submitting-code/) guide if you are new to GitHub or development in general
* Now you are ready to pick your first issue

#### Where to look for your first issue

* You can look through issues tagged with the [“good first issue for devs”](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue+for+devs%22) label, which is used to indicate the issues that are especially approachable for new contributors.&#x20;
* We also use the "good first issue for experienced devs" label to tag issues that are recommended to developers who have relevant expertise or extensive general software development experience.
* In addition, there are issues tagged with the "help wanted" label, which are ready for contributions.

#### Claim an issue

* Post a comment to the issue thread that you would like to claim. @annieappflowy will assign you to the issue and label the issue as “in progress”.
* New contributors can only claim one issue until their first pull request is merged. This is to encourage folks to finish ongoing work before starting something new.&#x20;

#### Working on an issue

* We encourage early pull requests for work in progress.&#x20;
* It's normal and totally ok if your first PR takes you a while.&#x20;

## Sponsor

Sponsoring is another great way to contribute to the community.

* Buy us a coffee on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/appflowy)
* For more extensive sponsorship, please contact Annie at [annie@appflowy.io](mailto:annie@appflowy.io)

# \[Draft] Use Case: Software Engineer

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow software engineers! Today, I want to share with you how I use Appflowy to stay organized and productive in my work. As software engineers, we all know how important it is to keep track of our projects, deadlines, and tasks. That's where Appflowy comes in! With its simple and intuitive design, Appflowy makes it easy to stay on top of everything.

Prior to proceeding with the installation, it is essential to ensure that your machine meets the specified [System Requirements](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/install-appflowy/requirements).\
Here are the [Installation methods](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/install-appflowy/installation-methods) that provide clear guidance on how to successfully install Appflowy.\
Should you be interested in contributing to AppFlowy or accessing its source code, we encourage you to explore the dedicated [Contribute to AppFlowy section](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy). After installation, users can pick a folder for saving data on the quick start page.

## Setting Up

Once you have AppFlowy installed, simply create a new page for your software engineering projects. This page will serve as your central hub, where you can structure and categorize your tasks. For example, when using AppFlowy for software engineering, you can create sections like "Project Planning" for goals, requirements, and milestones.&#x20;

"Development Tasks" helps manage project-specific tasks. Use "Bugs and Issues" to log and address problems, and a "Project Completion" section to track final steps for successful delivery. By creating these sections within your page, you can easily navigate through your projects and find the information you need without any confusion. AppFlowy provides a clean and intuitive interface that allows you to stay focused and organized throughout the software engineering process.

## Benefits of using AppFlowy as a Software Engineer

Before we dive into the details, let's talk about the benefits of using Appflowy as a software engineer. First and foremost, AppFlowy helps me stay organized. With its ability to create structured pages, I can keep all my projects, tasks, and notes in one place. Additionally, I can easily share my pages in Markdown(.md file) with my team and keep everyone on the same page.

## Project Planning

Now that we have our workspace set up, let's talk about how to use AppFlowy for project planning. To plan a project in AppFlowy, I create a new list for the project and add notes and tags as needed. For example, I might create a note for the project goal, a note for the requirements, and a note for each milestone. By tagging each note with the project name, I can easily find all the notes related to that project.

## Development Tasks:

Once I have my project plan in place, it's time to start working on the development tasks. To manage my development tasks, I create a new list for each task and add notes and tags as needed. For example, I might create a note for the task description, a note for any subtasks, and a note for the estimated time to complete. By tagging each note with the project name and task name, I can easily find all the notes related to that task.

## Bugs and Issues

Of course, no software project is without its bugs and issues. That's where Appflowy's bug tracking features come in. To track bugs and issues, I create a new list for each issue and add notes and tags as needed. For example, I might create a note for the bug description, a note for the steps to reproduce, and a note for the priority level. By tagging each note with the project name and issue name, I can easily find all the notes related to that issue.

## Project Completion

Once all the development tasks are completed and all the bugs are fixed, it's time to wrap up the project. To manage the project completion, I create a new list for the project and add notes and tags as needed. For example, I might create a note for the final deliverables, a note for any outstanding issues, and a note for the project status. By tagging each note with the project name, I can easily find all the notes related to that project.

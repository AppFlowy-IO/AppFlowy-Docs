## How does it work?

#### Post to Discord About Your Topic

First, join our Discord[ channel](https://discord.gg/s9yQttsP53) and create a post. Your post should include the topic you want to cover and an outline. The topic can be your own or select an existing GitHub issue tagged with “[write-for-appflowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awrite-for-appflowy)".

#### Wait for Approval on the Topic

Once you create a post, the AppFlowy team will review it. It may take a few days or weeks for us to review.&#x20;

If we shortlist your topic, we will work with you to refine the scope and outline of the article to ensure the result is informative and engaging.&#x20;

We will then create a GitHub issue for the topic and assign the issue to you.

#### Get Feedback

After you finish the first draft, you are encouraged to get feedback from the AppFlowy team and a few community members who are your article’s target audience.&#x20;

You should be aware that not every submitted article will be published.

#### Publication of Your Article

Once your article is reviewed and published on our blog, you can submit your invoice to get paid via[ Deel](https://www.deel.com/).&#x20;

But that’s not all — we’ll also promote your work on our social media channels, providing greater exposure for your work.

#### Ongoing Support

Ongoing support is required. You should promptly respond to queries about your published work. How-to guides should remain up-to-date.&#x20;

We expect that you will provide support for at least 30 days after your article is published. Future engagements will be contingent on how well existing articles are supported.

We may archive your how-to guides if it’s not up-to-date given that our product is still under rapid development and may evolve pretty quickly.

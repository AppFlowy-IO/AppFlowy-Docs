# Profiling

AppFlowy uses [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) to debug the Rust backend. It would be very useful when having the high CPU usage issues.

## Prerequisites

Install the tokio-console by running the following command

```shell
cargo install --locked tokio-console
```

and run locally

```shell
tokio-console
```

## Enable profiling

The `flowy-core` crate has a feature called `profiling`. Just enable this feature in the cargo.toml.

Using [Xcode instruments](https://github.com/cmyr/cargo-instruments) to profile the backend.

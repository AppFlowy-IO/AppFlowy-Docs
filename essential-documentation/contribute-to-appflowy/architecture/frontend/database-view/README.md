# Database View

## Introduction

This document explains how the Grid, Board, and Calendar shares the same data structs defined in the backend. It can be a development guide when you want to contribute to the Grid, Board or Calendar feature. This document will be continuously updated, and all suggestions are appreciated.

## View Definitions
Below you will find some quick definitions to help you read through the document.

| Database | AppFlowy self-defined database that manages the relation between columns,rows, and cells.            |
| Grid     | A Grid type is a simple representation of items placed in columns and rows                           |
| Board    | A Board is an project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress        |
| Calendar | A Calendar allows you to display data associated with dates and times in day, week or month formats. |

## Relations

Currently, AppFlowy has three types of views that share the same database. A single database can have multiple views and these views can be converted to each other.

## Events and notifications

The database views use [events and notifications](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/architecture/frontend/inter-process-communication) to exchange the data between the frontend and backend.
When triggering an event, there may be notifications sent to the frontend asynchronously. The database events are defined [here](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/architecture/frontend/database-view/events).

Below you will find some quick definitions about the database.

| Database     | A Database struct that contains a list of fields and rows                              |
| Field        | A Field represents a column of the database. Different fields have different `FieldType`s |
| FieldType    | A `FieldType` represents the type of column.                                             |
| TypeOption   | A `TypeOption` represents the configuration of the `Field`.                              |
| Row          | A `Row` represents a group of related cells.                                             |
| Cell         | A `Cell` contains the data of the corresponding `FieldType`                              |
| TypeCellData | Same as `Cell` but carry the `FieldType` when the `Cell` create                          |

### Database
A database is a collection of rows and columns, as shown in the picture below. It allows for the creation of more rows and columns.
Each row contains a list of cells and each cell corresponds to a specific column. The number of cells is equal to
the number of columns in a row. Each column, aka a `Field`, contains the configuration of how to format the cell.

### Field
A Field represents a column in the database. It has a property called `field_ty`, which is an enum defined in FieldType.
The `FieldType` defines the kind of data contained in a column. Such as date, number, text, multi-select, etc. This data
is stored in the `typeOptions` property, which is a Map. The key is the `FieldType`, and the value is the `TypeOption`.

The current field type of the column is determined by the `field_ty` property. As shown in the picture below. There are two Fields in the database.

### FieldType
A `FieldType` represents the type of the `Field`. Currently, AppFlowy supports `text`,`numbers`,`date`,`select`,`multi-select`,
`checkbox`,`URL`, and `checklist` as shown in the picture below.

![field_type.png](assets/field_type.png)

### TypeOption
A `TypeOption` represents the configuration of the `Field`. Certain `TypeOption`s have user-defined options such as color,
date format, number format, or a list of values for a multi-select list.

For example, A `Field` with `SingleSelect` field type contains the name and a list of options as shown in the picture below.

![type_option.png](assets/type_option.png)

A `Field` with `Number` field type contains the name and a list of format styles as shown in the picture below.

![img.png](assets/number_type_option.png)

### Row
A `Row` contains a list of related cells, and each cell corresponds to a specific column. Which means the number of cells is
equal to the number of the `Fields` that the database has.

![grid_row.png](assets/grid_row.png)

### Cell
A `Cell` contains the data of the corresponding `FieldType`.

![img.png](assets/cell.png)

Most of the time, the data of cell is not human-readable. A cell doesn't know how to represent itself. It needs the `Field`'s
`TypeOption` to format the data. As shown in the below image, it describes how the cell data get formatted step by step.

![file : database\_view.plantuml](../../../../../uml/output/database\_view\_classes-Read\_Cell\_Sequence.svg)

1. Get the corresponding `Database` with `database_id`
2. Get the corresponding `Field` with `field_id`
3. Get the corresponding `TypeOption` base on the current value of the `Field`'s `field_ty` property. Assuming the `field_ty` is `FieldType::Date`.
4. Get the corresponding `Row` with `row_id`
5. Get the corresponding `Cell` with `field_id`
6. Using the `DateTypeOption` to format the raw cell data.
7. Returns the formatted cell data

The formatted cell data will be different depending on the `DateFormat` and `TimeFormat` of the `DateTypeOption`.

| DateFormat     | TimeFormat     | Raw cell data |                     |

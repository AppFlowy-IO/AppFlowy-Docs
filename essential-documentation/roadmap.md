#### Item Status

‚ÄúStatus‚Äù indicates the stages that the feature goes through, from ‚ÄúNeed triage‚Äù to ‚ÄúDone‚Äù. Most of the options are self explanatory.:

* Need triage
* Need test for Windows / Linux / macOS
* Wait for reporter
* Ready for assess
* Planned: included in our plan
* Not Planned: decided against it
* ToDo: in the queue of the upcoming development (next two releases)
* In progress: currently in development
* Blocked: have started but can‚Äôt proceed as it is blocked by something
* Done: the development is finished and merged into the main branch

#### Milestones

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense of how far out each item is on the horizon. If a feature is planned, it is already or will be added to a particular milestone, aka release. For example, ‚ÄúImplement FlowyEditor‚Äôs RichText component‚Äù is added to v0.0.7. You will also find issues that are not planned for which no milestone is yet available. In addition, you can see a list of milestones that are already planned and track their progress [here](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/milestones).

# How to get help

## Overview

We want your experience with AppFlowy to be smooth and positive from day one! We realise, though, that a bit of assistance at the right time can help, especially when AppFlowy is still at an early stage of the development.

To deliver an effortless onboarding experience, we've put together a list of resources designed to give the answers you need.

## Essential Documentation

What you are looking at - the AppFlowy Essential Documentation - is likely one of the best resources to start with. This wiki provides a wide range of instructions and how-tos for AppFlowy. Even if you don't have a specific question, this is a great place to start on your journey with AppFlowy. And we encourage you to continue to check it out as we are continuously updating and adding new documentation.

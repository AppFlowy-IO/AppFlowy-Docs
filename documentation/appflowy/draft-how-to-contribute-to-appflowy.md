## How to Identify and Open Your First PR

Contributions are made via Pull Requests (PRs).

We recommend getting familiar with the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for collaborating on projects and setting up your development environment.

Once you're ready, start looking for a PR to work on. If you need help getting started, look at [AppFlowy's documentation](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/software-contributions).

### Finding an Issue to Work On

**Step 1:** Go to [AppFlowy's repository](https://github.com/orgs/AppFlowy-IO/repositories) section on GitHub. This is a list of all of AppFlowy's repositories open for contributions. For the purposes of this article, we shall be looking for _Issues_ within the main [AppFlowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy) repository.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/715c8a61-af5f-4856-840f-11f8604e765c" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>AppFlowy Github Page - With all open-source repositories that can be worked on</em></p></figcaption></figure>

**Step 2:** Go to the _Issues_ section of the repository. It should look something like this:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/14fdc0e3-1517-40da-9576-4646b0516b36" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Issues Section</em></p></figcaption></figure>

**Step 3:** Go to the label subsection, and type in "Good First Issue for Devs"

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/f5dedcd1-5f08-483d-9898-6372022060b3" alt=""><figcaption><p> <em>Label Subsections Within Issues</em></p></figcaption></figure>

**Step 4:** Here, you can go through a list of _Issues_ that can be worked on. They're fairly straightforward and can help you get accustomed to the development environment as well as the codebase.

Feel free to ask anyone from the AppFlowy team for suggestions or to assign you to an Issue.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/e1022103-e98e-42b5-a43d-03f5c5b08f04" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Good First Issue for Devs</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Issues are generally categorized into either a Feature \[FR] or a Bug \[Bug]. You can take a look at the description provided for the given issue.

Send a message down in the comments section to get the issue assigned to yourself. Once that's done, you are ready to begin coding!

Note:

* Don't worry about being assigned before starting work on it. Even if you aren't assigned, all pull requests that solve a GitHub issue are appreciated.
* However, please do understand that even though you can work on issues that haven't been assigned to you, there is an increased possibility that this will lead to merge conflicts should it end up being assigned to someone else.
* You are also free to suggest improvements on an issue assigned to someone else.

## My Experience Handling My First PR

In this section, I will highlight my personal experience with AppFlowy, from why I decided to contribute, the workflow that I followed, and the overall experience of going about Open-Source development.

### Why I Decided to Contribute to AppFlowy

My first contribution for AppFlowy came during the [GitHub Octernships](https://education.github.com/students/octernships) season. I had heard about the GitHub Octernships through a promotional video that I had found on YouTube.

Considering how similar it was to GSOC and other Open Source initiatives, I was interested in trying it out. I registered for the event, and after careful consideration, decided to choose AppFlowy as one of my four entries.

The initial appeal of AppFlowy was clear, it was a productivity tool suite, competing with heavyweights like Notion and Todoist, and most importantly, it was Open Source in nature. That meant a third-year junior like myself could have a shot at development experience, without much hassle.

AppFlowy is built out of Flutter and Rust, which were completely new to me. However, considering the pros of the Octernships program, I decided to enroll anyway. I joined the AppFlowy Discord Server, introduced myself, and quickly got down to completing the assignment.

This brought me to handling a PR for any first-time issue for Junior Devs. This was a compulsory part of the Octernships application, which officially started my Open Source journey with AppFlowy.

### Searching for My First Issue

I began by searching for issues on the main AppFlowy repository.

I had contributed to minor open-source projects before and knew how one generally went about contributing to open-source repositories. I entered the words "good-first-issue" in the label bar and selected the first option, i.e., good first issues for junior devs.

This was my first time working with Flutter, so I decided it was best that I started out with something easy. I decided to go ahead with issue [#1059 - Support markdown to italicize text](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues/1059).

The requirements were fairly simple: _Add a function to enable italics via the use of single asterisks._

After going through the codebase, I knew it would just involve copying and editing a pre-existing function that did the same for underscores, so I decided to go ahead with it.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/4f746dfb-0f50-41aa-8c04-e5660cedc5e3" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>A view of the issue that I decided to take on</em></p></figcaption></figure>

I started by asking one of the moderators if I could work on the issue. The core team got back to me on what I could work on, specifically with respect to the given issue. Once I got assigned the issue, I was ready to get started.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/60633c00-bf46-4d19-99a6-775213b0a370" alt=""><figcaption><p> <em>Always Ask Questions - Clarify your thoughts, as well as your plans for implementation with the Team</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### How I Solved It

As mentioned before, it was a fairly straightforward issue, with code already present in the codebase that could be reused for the same.

However, I had a lot of trouble setting up my development environment. This is a common issue for first-timers, so don't worry if you have trouble setting up your environment as well.

I had issues with the unpacking of the cargo files for the Rust backend. This mostly came down to my antivirus flagging all the incoming files needed for development.

It took a while of troubleshooting, and asking for help from the community, but I was eventually able to figure it out and get the environment up and running.

Some things that I did to smoothen my onboarding experience included:

* Read up on AppFlowy's documentation and search for cases where this bug has been encountered before, and how it was dealt with.
* Searching on online platforms for cases where such an error was encountered before. This included combing through popular sites like Stack Overflow, other GitHub repositories, BitBucket, etc. for any instances where this issue had occurred before, and any potential fixes for the same.
* Creating an issue in the Issues tab and highlighting the exact problem that I faced. I carefully detailed the exact issue that I was facing, including screenshots, error messages, and any other relevant information pertaining to the issue that I was facing. (You can have a look at Issue [#2045](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues/2045). This is a fairly good example of how one can approach roadblocks on their development journey).

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/919bfd67-9e32-427e-b817-1ea72c06b0e2" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>An example of an issue created to help gain feedback from the community on how to best tackle it</em></p></figcaption></figure>

* Asking on Discord - you may do so on the flutter-101 and rust-101 channels.

Following these steps helped me successfully fix the issue that I was facing.

Also, _always document_ everything that occurs during the lifecycle of an issue resolution within your Issue and PR. Doing so will help future contributors who might encounter the same issue down the road.

With the environment up and running, it was time to make the changes needed to fulfill the task at hand.

I added the function required, tested it manually in my local environment, and pushed the ensuing commit into my forked repository's branch. I then created a pull request for the same and awaited my first code review.

### Clarifying Doubts With Maintainers

As always, feel free to ask questions when you have doubts and seek suggestions from the maintainers and the core team. You can ask questions related to any feature you'd like to implement, any bug that you've encountered, and so on.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/0aa7325a-7212-4df1-ba51-a127471b29d7" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>An example of a community member helping me resolve an issue</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### How I Handled Code Reviews With the Team

As a first-time contributor to a repository, you will be asked to sign the CLA, i.e., the [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor\_License\_Agreement).

Once that's done, your Pull Request will be assigned to one or more reviewers. They are generally members of the core AppFlowy team or senior contributors. They know the codebase in and out, so feel free to ask for suggestions on how to tackle any developmental issue that you may face.

My reviewers left some suggested changes for the Pull Request, including changing keyboard conventions and other small changes.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/242608e8-6295-4e8c-8d61-7709cb04b4cd" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>An example of a suggested review left by reviewers during a dode review of a pull request</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Another requirement that was put forward by the team was to make unit tests for the new feature.

Unit testing is important as it makes sure that individual changes made to a codebase function as intended. I had a horrid time writing these unit tests, as I was still very new to Flutter. But as always, feel free to ask for help.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/7ab3576c-b392-4b23-8ba6-1aaa7e081dc0" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Asking for help - just do it!</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Always make sure you conform to the conventions put in place by the team such as:

* Pull Request naming conventions
* Following commit message guidelines
* Eliminating warnings and TODOs

For more information on the naming conventions used in AppFlowy, check out our [code submission guidelines](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/software-contributions/submitting-code/code-submission-guidelines)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/ebd65d9e-70c5-4801-ac53-ff0459ee17f2" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Make sure you use the naming conventions specified by the AppFlowy documentation</em></p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/c1e546a5-9c97-4682-9b23-a44f9d39c553" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Ended up having trouble with squashing some commits as well. This really was quite the journey ðŸ˜…</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Overall, I think I made quite a mess with my first Pull Request. From horrible coding practices to terrible naming conventions, I had it all!

But thanks to the community, I was able to navigate the entire process with relative ease. A big thank you to [Xazin](https://github.com/Xazin) and [LucasXu0](https://github.com/LucasXu0) for all their help and support.

This really is what I admire the most at AppFlowy: the **Community**.

So stay hungry, always be open to suggestions, and you'll be surprised by just how much you can learn while working on a large-scale, open-source collaborative project like AppFlowy.

### The Final Merge Request

<figure><img src="https://github.com/JRS296/AppFlowy-Docs/assets/70965472/1a57eece-041f-4862-a99f-0bc604179740" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>The first of many more Pull Requests!</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Things That I Learnt Through This Whole Experience

To summarize, here are my key takeaways from the entire experience:

* Be open to suggestions and constructive criticism. We can't learn if we close our minds to change.
* Learn the languages and frameworks of the codebase! I cannot stress this enough. Try to have a firm understanding of the basics of the frameworks and languages used, namely Flutter and Rust. Feel free to refer to the Section [Resources for Getting Started With Technical Contributions](draft-how-to-contribute-to-appflowy.md#resources-for-getting-started-with-technical-contributions) below for the same.
* Follow the conventions and standards put in place. Be it coding or naming conventions, make sure you follow the conventions put in place by the community.
* Feel free to ask questions! But at the same time, make sure you've done your research. Whenever you encounter a roadblock, try Googling the issue first. Chances are, you'd be able to get an answer to your question without having to wait for a community member to respond. In case you're truly stuck, do not be afraid to reach out. The community is behind you every step of the way.
* Document everything! Make sure to document any bugs and issues that you encounter. These can be useful to future contributors down the road, who may encounter the same.

# 🍎 Building on macOS

**Note:**

* If you encounter any issues, have a look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/wiki/Troubleshooting) first. If your issue is not included in the page, please create an [issue](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/issues/new/choose) or ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9Q2xaN37tV).

## **Step 1: Get the source code**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should fork the code instead if you wish to submit code to AppFlowy. You'll find information on that in [setting-up-your-repositories.md](../../../../../essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/software-contributions/submitting-code/setting-up-your-repositories.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy.git
```

## **Step 2: Install Flutter**

{% hint style="info" %}
Skip this if flutter is already installed on your system.
{% endhint %}

* Follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter.
  * It will ask you to run `flutter doctor` to check any dependencies you need to install to complete the setup.
    * It is not necessary to install Android toolchain and Android studio to run AppFlowy.
    * However, CocoaPods and VS Code are required.
* Make sure you also install the [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) & [Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) extensions in VS Code.

## **Step 3: Install your build environment**

* Run the setup script from the base directory
  * It will guide you through to install Rust, which is required by AppFlowy

```bash
./frontend/scripts/install_dev_env/install_macos.sh
```

> FYI, AppFlowy uses [https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) to construct the build scripts. It is important that you add (dart) `pub` to $PATH, otherwise VS Code may error out. Add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` in `$HOME`:
>
> ```
> export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
> ```
>
> Make sure to restart your terminal and VS Code

## **Step 4: Edit and run the application**

1. Open the `frontend` folder located at `xx/AppFlowy/frontend` with VS Code. It is important _not_ to open the root folder, as that will not give access to the appropriate debug commands.
2. Open `xx/AppFlowy/frontend/appflowy_flutter/lib/main.dart` and then check the device selection: ![device](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86001920/144546864-cebbf0c0-4eef-424e-93c7-e1e6b3a59669.png)
3. Go to the Run and Debug tab and then click AF-desktop: Clean + Rebuild All for the first time running.

## Building in release mode

1. Go to the AppFlowy/frontend/ directory.
2. Run the following command to build the binary depending on your architecture.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="x86" %}
```shell
cargo make --profile production-mac-x86_64 appflowy
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="arm64" %}
```shell
cargo make --profile production-mac-arm64 appflowy
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The scripts are located in the AppFlowy/frontend/Makefile.toml file.

The resulting binary file is located in `AppFlowy/frontend/appflowy_flutter/product/x.x.x/[OS]/Release/AppFlowy/`.

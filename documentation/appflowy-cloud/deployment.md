# ☀ Deployment

# Background

- This deployment architecture is designed to make self-hosting AppFlowy-Cloud as easy as possible.
- Deployment can be done in a single machine which only needs `docker` to be installed.
- [Cloud Deployment Guide](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud/blob/main/doc/deployment.md)


# Deployment Architecture

## Routing

- After `docker compose up -d` is ran, AppFlowy-Cloud will be serving in [localhost](http://localhost) at both port 80 and 443
- Host Machine should expose either HTTP(80) or HTTPS(443) port.
- AppFlowy Native Application should then be configured to connect to Host Machine through IP or hostname.
- `/gotrue` → GoTrue Auth Server
- `/api` → AppFlowy-Cloud HTTP
- `/ws` → AppFlowy-Cloud Web Socket
- `/web`  → AppFlowy User Admin Frontend
- `/pgadmin` → Postgres database control panel
- `/minio` → Minio Web UI
- `/portainer` → Container Management
